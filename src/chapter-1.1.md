# Getting Started

## Installation

To use Puppeteer in your project, run:

```bash
npm install puppeteer
# or
yarn add puppeteer
# or
pnpm add puppeteer
```

When you install Puppeteer, it automatically downloads a recent version of Chrome for Testing (~170MB macOS, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Windows) and a `chrome-headless-shell binary` that is guaranteed to work with Puppeteer. The browser is downloaded to the $HOME/.cache/puppeteer folder by default
